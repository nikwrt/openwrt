This is nikwrt's Backfire (10.03.x) OpenWrt Linux fork. 

Motivation: older routers with only 4 MB flash and 16 MB RAM
do not work well (or at all) with later OpenWrt releases. 

Unfortunately Backfire no longer builds on current Linux
distributions following security fixes in recent versions 
of bash. In addition Backfire is EOL and no patches are 
accepted anymore: https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/20859

This fork starts with a minimal set of changes to allow 
building on current systems (tested on Debian Jessie x64).

Further patches to refresh important packages will follow
in due course.

Have fun,
nikwrt

----- Original README follows

This is the buildsystem for the OpenWrt Linux distribution

Please use "make menuconfig" to configure your appreciated
configuration for the toolchain and firmware.

You need to have installed gcc, binutils, patch, bzip2, flex,
make, gettext, pkg-config, unzip, libz-dev and libc headers.

Simply running 'make' will build your firmware.
It will download all sources, build the cross-compile toolchain, 
the kernel and all choosen applications.

You can use scripts/flashing/flash.sh for remotely updating your embedded
system via tftp.

The OpenWrt system is documented in docs/. You will need a LaTeX distribution
and the tex4ht package to build the documentation. Type make -C docs/ to build it.

Building your own firmware you need to have access to a Linux, BSD or MacOSX system.
Cygwin will not be supported because of the lack of case sensitiveness.

Sunshine!
